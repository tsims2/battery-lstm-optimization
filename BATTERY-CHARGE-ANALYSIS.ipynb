    "# Battery Charge Analysis\n",
    "This notebook uses the lstm_model and battery_analysis modules to forecast emissions, energy costs, and other incentives and analyse optimal battery performance with provided battery information. It performs hourly analysis and forecasts one month at a time based on the ISONE region. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Battery Benefits\n",
    "Batteries provide three primary benefits. They reduce carbon footprints, they lower energy bills, and they can participate in various incentive programs. These benefits are determined base on the energy source makeup, price of energy, energy demand, and program calls at any given hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Carbon Accounting** If we charge a battery during hours when energy has a low emission profile and then discharges that energy when the emissions are high, the battery is reducing overall emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy Savings** If we charge a battery during hours when energy prices are low and then discharges that energy when the prices are high, the battery is reducing overall energy costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Incentive Payouts** A battery can discharge during specific hours if it is enrolled in select incentive programs. This participation receives direct payment. \n",
